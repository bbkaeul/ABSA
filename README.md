### Domain Adaptation (Transfer learning, SNE)
Unified Feature and Instance Based Domain Adaptation for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.572.pdf)
- Feature-based methods learn a domain-invariant representation with autiliary tasks or domain adversarial learning
- Instance-based methods is to re-weight source instances in order to assign higher weights to instances similar to the target domain and lower weights to instances different from the target domain
