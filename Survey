### Core Issues and Challenges of AbSA
1. How to perform the process of AE effectively?; Why till now this remains a big challenge?
  1-1. How to extract explicit aspects, OTE, implicit aspects and aspects with neutral sentiment?
  1-2. How to perform cross-domain and cross-lingual AE?
  1-3. How to map relationships between different data objects for improved AE?
2. How to conduct ASA?; how to achieve a sentimental calculation model that performs an in-depth analysis of all the emotional aspects?; why this is still a big challenge and hot research area?
  2-1. How to perform SA at asepct(target), entity and multi-word-target level?
  2-2. How multi-task learning enhances the sentiment prediction accuracy?
  2-3. How the interactions, dependencies and contextual-semantic relationships between data objects contribute towards improved sentiment classification?
3. How to measure the change of sentiment value with time?; why there is not any outstanding achievement which makes SE an open issue?
  3-1. How to identify factors and track obvious deficiencies in continuously-changingsentimental characteristics?
  3-2. How to predict SE over Social data?
  
### Aspect Extraction (AE)
AE deals with detection and discovery of explicit aspects, implicit aspects, entities, aspect categories and OTE. AE also tackles the relation distribution between different
aspects in order to identify consistent, coherent and similar aspects from the dataset that help in improving the overall representation of extracted aspects.
